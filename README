ScheduleFu
==========
This plugin is just beginning. It will allow scheduling events with dates and
times. It will include both the model and view portions of a calendar. This will
borrow heavily from acts_as_calendar (http://github.com/dball/acts_as_calendar)
and calendar_helper (http://github.com/topfunky/calendar_helper).
